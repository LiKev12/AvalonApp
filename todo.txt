[X] Create game in Lobby
[] Auth workflow for game
[X] Use axios api directly in component to getRooms (no need to store games in redux state)



11/30
[] Make every action (CREATE, SETUP, etc. ) atomic (all-or-nothing), and check if game exists (error-proof it)



12/1
[] finish handle setup (create board file, getBoard as a function of roles, num_players)
[] make a centralized characters list (and test it! have fun with it)
    - consider:
        - gamesetupmodal (client)
        - server game core (would need to update 2 files)
[] Make room leader tracked on server instead of client
[] Create ordered_ids and ordered_players to init single board view (and handshake by id on client-side)
